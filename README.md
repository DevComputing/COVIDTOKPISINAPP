# COVIDINTOKPISIN
Free Android awareness app in TOKPISIN - language commonly spoken in Papua New Guinea. 


Android was the chosen platform for this project mainly due to current stats pointing to a large number of people in the country using Android devices. Also, the goal was to reach people in the rural areas and so it make sense to have an android awareness app. 

Developers wanting to contribute are most welcome!
